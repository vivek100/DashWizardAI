**Requirements and Design for a Self-Calling AI Agent Using LangGraph's ReAct Agent**

This document outlines the requirements, tools, and technological approach for building a self-calling AI agent that autonomously performs multi-step data analysis on CSV files, including numerical and contextual text analysis. The agent leverages **LangGraph’s ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) Agent** to sequentially call multiple tools, reason about the analysis process, and deliver a final result. The implementation uses **pandas** for data manipulation tools and **DuckDB** for persistent storage of CSV data and analysis results, ensuring a robust, scalable, and secure solution.

**1\. Requirements**

**1.1 Functional Requirements**

* **Autonomous Multi-Step Analysis**:  
  * The AI agent must autonomously execute multi-step data analysis tasks on CSV files, combining numerical (e.g., filtering, grouping, joining) and textual analysis (e.g., sentiment, theme extraction) based on user input or inferred goals.  
  * For text data (e.g., employee survey comments), the agent should extract sentiments (e.g., positive, negative, neutral), themes (e.g., management, culture), and generate structured reports with citations.  
  * Example: For a prompt like “Analyze survey comments for sentiment and themes, then count themes by department,” the agent loads the CSV, extracts insights, adds them to the data, and performs numerical analysis.  
* **Tool Integration**:  
  * Provide tools for loading CSVs, fetching table names and schemas, executing numerical queries (pandas-based), analyzing text data (sentiment, themes), generating text reports, and saving results as tables or views.  
  * Text analysis tools must support dynamic theme creation, allowing the AI to propose new themes if predefined ones are insufficient.  
* **Data Storage**:  
  * Store all CSV data and analysis results in DuckDB tables or views for persistence.  
  * Original CSV data must remain read-only, preventing any modifications.  
  * Support direct CSV querying in DuckDB without loading into tables when feasible.  
  * Store text analysis results (e.g., sentiment, themes) as additional columns in DuckDB tables or as separate tables linked by unique identifiers (e.g., employee\_id or row index).  
  * Store text reports (e.g., JSON or markdown summaries with citations) in DuckDB as text fields or structured tables.  
* **Result Accessibility**:  
  * Final analysis results must be accessible as DuckDB tables or views for querying by other processes.  
  * Results must also be available as Python objects (pandas DataFrames) for in-memory access.  
  * Text analysis results (e.g., sentiment, themes) must be integrated into original tables for numerical analysis (e.g., group by theme).  
  * Reports must be accessible as JSON or text in DuckDB or as DataFrames for downstream processing.  
  * Avoid requiring the AI to manually write results to files; store results in DuckDB or return DataFrames.  
* **Self-Calling Behavior**:  
  * Use LangGraph’s ReAct framework to enable the agent to autonomously select and call tools, reason about intermediate results, and iterate until the task is complete.  
  * The agent must reason about combining numerical and textual tools (e.g., extract themes, then group by theme) and manage data via table names, avoiding raw data in LLM context.  
  * Handle errors and adjust plans dynamically based on tool outputs or failures.  
* **Query Flexibility**:  
  * Support multi-step numerical queries (e.g., filter, join, aggregate) using pandas DataFrame operations.  
  * Support text analysis queries (e.g., sentiment, theme extraction) using an LLM (e.g., Grok 3\) with batch processing for efficiency.  
  * Optionally allow SQL queries via DuckDB for text and numerical data, returning DataFrames.  
* **User Interaction**:  
  * Accept high-level natural language prompts (e.g., “Join two CSVs, filter rows, and compute averages” or “Analyze survey comments for sentiment, add themes, and generate a report”).  
  * Return structured results, including table/view names, DataFrame previews, or report summaries.

**1.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance**:  
  * Efficiently handle small to medium CSVs (\<1GB) using pandas in-memory operations.  
  * Leverage DuckDB’s columnar storage and out-of-core processing for larger datasets or complex queries.  
  * Minimize query execution time for analytical tasks like aggregations, joins, and text analysis.  
  * Optimize text analysis for 40–100 comments by batching requests to the LLM, avoiding token limit issues.  
* **Scalability**:  
  * Support multiple CSVs and concurrent analysis tasks without significant performance degradation.  
  * Efficiently process text data by integrating token management into text analysis tools, ensuring LLM quota compliance.  
* **Security**:  
  * Enforce read-only access to original CSV data loaded into DuckDB tables.  
  * Validate queries and text analysis outputs to prevent unauthorized operations (e.g., updates, deletes) or invalid data integration.  
  * Secure DuckDB database files with appropriate permissions.  
* **Simplicity**:  
  * Implement a straightforward Python-based solution, minimizing dependencies.  
  * Use generic tool names (e.g., analyze\_text, generate\_text\_report) for flexibility across text data types.  
  * Ensure the agent’s reasoning and tool-calling logic is maintainable and transparent.  
* **Compatibility**:  
  * Use pandas for data manipulation to leverage its rich API and ecosystem.  
  * Integrate DuckDB for persistent storage, replacing file-based CSV storage.  
  * Ensure text analysis results integrate seamlessly with pandas for numerical analysis.  
  * Support results accessible via Python (pandas DataFrames) and SQL (DuckDB).  
* **Robustness**:  
  * Handle errors gracefully (e.g., invalid CSV formats, query failures, text analysis inconsistencies).  
  * Provide clear error messages and recovery options for the agent to adjust its plan.  
* **Maintainability**:  
  * Structure tools as modular Python functions for easy updates.  
  * Document tool inputs, outputs, and usage for developer clarity.

**3\. System Design and Workflow**

**3.1 Architecture Overview**

The system comprises three main components:

* **ReAct Agent (LangGraph)**:  
  * Orchestrates the workflow, using an LLM to reason about user prompts, select tools, and combine results.  
  * Maintains state to track intermediate results, tool outputs, and errors.  
* **Tools (Pandas \+ DuckDB)**:  
  * Python functions for loading CSVs, fetching metadata, executing numerical and text queries, generating reports, and saving results.  
  * Pandas handles in-memory DataFrame operations; DuckDB manages persistent storage and querying.  
* **Data Storage (DuckDB)**:  
  * Stores original CSVs as read-only tables and analysis results as tables or views.  
  * Supports SQL and Python access for tools and external processes.

**3.2 Workflow**

* **User Input**:  
  * The user provides a natural language prompt (e.g., “Load survey\_data.csv, analyze comments for sentiment and themes, count themes by department, and generate a report with citations”).  
  * The prompt is passed to the ReAct agent.  
* **Reasoning (ReAct Agent)**:  
  * The LLM interprets the prompt, identifying required tools (e.g., load CSV, fetch schema, analyze text, execute query, generate report).  
  * It plans a sequence of tool calls, reasoning about dependencies (e.g., load CSV before analyzing text).  
  * It passes table names instead of raw data, using LangGraph’s state to track references.  
  * If intermediate results are ambiguous or errors occur, the agent re-evaluates and adjusts the plan.  
* **Tool Execution**:  
  * The agent calls tools sequentially, passing inputs (e.g., table names) and collecting outputs (e.g., DataFrames, table names).  
  * Tools use DuckDB for storage and pandas for analysis, with text tools leveraging Grok 3 for sentiment, themes, and reports.  
  * Example sequence:  
    * Load CSV into a DuckDB table.  
    * Fetch schema to inform text analysis.  
    * Analyze text for sentiment and themes, saving results to DuckDB.  
    * Execute a pandas query to group by theme.  
    * Generate a report with citations.  
* **Result Aggregation**:  
  * The agent combines tool outputs to produce the final result (e.g., a DataFrame, table/view name, report).  
  * It formats the result for user consumption (e.g., display DataFrame preview, provide table name, show report).  
* **Output Delivery**:  
  * Results are stored in DuckDB as tables or views for persistent access.  
  * Results are returned as pandas DataFrames for in-memory use by other processes.

**3.4 LangGraph ReAct Agent Setup**

* **Graph Structure**:  
  * **Nodes**:  
    * Reasoning Node: Uses the LLM to interpret prompts, plan tool calls, and evaluate outputs.  
    * Tool Nodes: Execute specific tools (e.g., load\_csv\_to\_table, execute\_query, analyze\_text, generate\_text\_report).  
    * Result Node: Aggregates outputs and formats the final result.  
  * **Edges**:  
    * Conditional edges based on reasoning outcomes (e.g., call another tool, retry, finalize).  
    * State transitions to track intermediate results and errors.  
* **State Management**:  
  * Maintains a state dictionary with:  
    * User prompt.  
    * Loaded table names (e.g., survey\_data\_12345678).  
    * Intermediate table names (e.g., survey\_data\_analyzed\_12345678).  
    * Tool outputs (e.g., schemas, query results, reports).  
    * Final result.  
  * Tracks table names instead of raw data, ensuring efficient data passing.  
* **LLM Integration**:  
  * Use Grok 3 (via xAI API at [https://x.ai/api](https://x.ai/api)) or an alternative LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude).  
  * Prompt the LLM to generate pandas query functions (e.g., lambda x: x\[x\['age'\] \> 30\].groupby('city')\['age'\].mean()), SQL queries, or text analysis outputs (e.g., sentiment, themes, reports).  
  * Example prompt for analyze\_text:

For each text entry, identify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and theme (from \[management, culture\] or propose a new theme). Return JSON:  
\[  
    {"index": 1, "sentiment": "positive", "theme": "work-life balance"},  
    {"index": 2, "sentiment": "negative", "theme": "management"}

* \]  
  * Example prompt for generate\_text\_report:

Analyze text entries, identify themes, summarize insights (max 50 words per theme), and cite by index. Return JSON:

* {"themes": \[{"theme": "management", "summary": "20% mention poor communication", "citations": \["2"\]}\]}  
  * Batch text entries to manage token limits, estimated within the tool.  
* **Error Handling**:  
  * Catch tool errors (e.g., invalid CSV, query failures, text analysis inconsistencies) and return to the LLM for retry or plan adjustment.  
  * Validate tool inputs/outputs to ensure correctness (e.g., DataFrame type, table existence, JSON format).

**3.5 Data Storage with DuckDB**

* **Original CSVs**:  
  * Loaded into DuckDB tables with unique names (e.g., csv\_table\_12345678, generated using timestamp and hash).  
  * Marked as read-only by restricting tools to SELECT, CREATE TABLE, and CREATE VIEW.  
  * Optionally queried directly from CSV files using DuckDB’s read\_csv\_auto for efficiency.  
* **Analysis Results**:  
  * Store numerical results (e.g., theme counts) as DuckDB tables/views.  
  * Store text analysis results as:  
    * New columns in existing tables (e.g., sentiment, theme).  
    * Separate tables linked by unique identifiers (e.g., employee\_id).  
  * Store reports as JSON strings in DuckDB tables (e.g., reports(report\_id, report\_text)) or structured tables (e.g., theme\_reports(theme, summary, citations)).  
* **Schema Management**:  
  * Use DuckDB’s DESCRIBE to provide column names and types for tools and the LLM.  
* **Performance Optimization**:  
  * Leverage DuckDB’s columnar storage for fast analytical queries (e.g., aggregations, joins).  
  * Use read\_csv\_auto for efficient CSV loading and schema inference.  
  * Support out-of-core processing for large CSVs, reducing memory usage.  
  * Batch text entries in analyze\_text and generate\_text\_report to optimize LLM calls.

**3.6 Security Measures**

* **Read-Only Access**:  
  * Restrict tools to non-destructive operations (SELECT, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW) on original tables.  
  * Use pandas DataFrame copies in execute\_query to prevent modifications.  
  * Validate SQL queries (if used) to block UPDATE, DELETE, or DROP.  
* **Query Validation**:  
  * Check pandas query functions and text analysis outputs for valid results (e.g., DataFrame type, valid sentiment values).  
  * Ensure table names exist before querying.  
  * Validate text analysis outputs (e.g., ensure sentiment is valid, themes are non-empty).  
* **Data Isolation**:  
  * Use unique table names to avoid conflicts (e.g., hash-based names).  
  * Store DuckDB files in a controlled directory with restricted permissions.  
* **Secure Configuration**:  
  * Store DuckDB database path and other settings in environment variables (via python-dotenv).  
  * Avoid hardcoding sensitive information.

* **LLM Availability**: Assumes access to Grok 3 (free tier or SuperGrok) or an alternative LLM. Usage quotas must be monitored (details at [https://x.ai/grok](https://x.ai/grok)).  
* **Prompt Clarity**: Assumes user prompts are clear, specifying analysis goals. Ambiguous prompts may require iterative clarification by the agent.  
* **Environment**: Assumes a Python environment with required libraries installed (Python 3.8+ recommended).  
* **Concurrency**: Assumes single-user access initially. Multi-user support requires DuckDB file locking or server mode.  
* **Query Complexity**: Assumes queries are analytical (e.g., filter, group, join, text analysis), suitable for pandas and DuckDB.
