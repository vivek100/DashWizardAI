# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current dashboard management system stores all dashboard and widget data in local Zustand state, including templates, user-created dashboards, and published dashboards. This approach lacks persistence across sessions, user data isolation, and scalability. We need to migrate the dashboard storage to Supabase to provide proper user authentication, data persistence, multi-device synchronization, and secure user data isolation while maintaining the existing functionality and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my dashboards to be saved to my personal account in Supabase, so that I can access them across different devices and sessions with proper data isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new dashboard THEN it SHALL be saved to Supabase with my user_id for data isolation
2. WHEN I log in from any device THEN I SHALL see only my personal dashboards, not other users' dashboards
3. WHEN I modify a dashboard THEN changes SHALL be automatically synced to Supabase in real-time
4. WHEN I delete a dashboard THEN it SHALL be removed from Supabase and all associated widgets SHALL be cascade deleted
5. WHEN I am offline THEN dashboard operations SHALL queue and sync when connection is restored

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want dashboard templates to be available to all users while maintaining my personal dashboard privacy, so that I can start with proven dashboard designs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access templates THEN I SHALL see system-wide template dashboards available to all users
2. WHEN I create a dashboard from a template THEN it SHALL be copied to my personal dashboards with my user_id
3. WHEN I publish a dashboard as a template THEN it SHALL be marked as a template and available to other users
4. WHEN templates are updated THEN all users SHALL see the updated versions without affecting their personal dashboards
5. WHEN I unpublish a template THEN it SHALL revert to a personal dashboard visible only to me

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want widget data to be properly associated with dashboards and my user account, so that dashboard layouts and configurations are preserved correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a widget to a dashboard THEN it SHALL be saved to Supabase with proper dashboard_id and user_id associations
2. WHEN I update widget configuration THEN changes SHALL be synced to Supabase immediately
3. WHEN I delete a widget THEN it SHALL be removed from Supabase without affecting other widgets
4. WHEN I reorder widgets THEN position changes SHALL be persisted to Supabase
5. WHEN a dashboard is deleted THEN all associated widgets SHALL be automatically deleted via cascade

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dashboard store to seamlessly integrate with Supabase while maintaining the existing API surface, so that existing components continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard store functions are called THEN they SHALL interact with Supabase instead of local state
2. WHEN Supabase operations fail THEN appropriate error handling SHALL be implemented with user-friendly messages
3. WHEN the store initializes THEN it SHALL fetch user's dashboards from Supabase automatically
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN dashboard data SHALL be cleared or loaded appropriately
5. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN dashboard changes SHALL be synchronized across all tabs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want dashboard publishing and sharing capabilities, so that I can share my dashboards with other users or make them available as templates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I publish a dashboard THEN it SHALL be marked as published and potentially visible to other users
2. WHEN I unpublish a dashboard THEN it SHALL revert to private status visible only to me
3. WHEN I share a dashboard THEN other users SHALL be able to view it based on sharing permissions
4. WHEN I copy a shared dashboard THEN it SHALL be added to my personal dashboards
5. WHEN published dashboards are accessed THEN proper permissions SHALL be enforced based on user authentication
