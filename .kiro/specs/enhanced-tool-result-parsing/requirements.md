# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The chat interface currently renders all tool results as generic tool result components, but the backend now sends structured JSON data with specific types ("error", "widget", "dashboard", "upload_prompt") that need to be parsed and rendered as their appropriate specialized components. This enhancement will improve the user experience by displaying the correct UI components for each type of tool result.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want tool results containing widget data to be displayed as interactive widget previews, so that I can immediately see and interact with the generated widgets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool result contains JSON with type "widget" THEN the system SHALL parse the content and render it using the widget component renderer
2. WHEN the widget component is rendered THEN the system SHALL display the widget preview with appropriate controls (Add to Dashboard button)
3. IF the JSON parsing fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to the generic tool result display

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want tool results containing dashboard data to be displayed as dashboard previews, so that I can see the complete dashboard layout and save it if desired.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool result contains JSON with type "dashboard" THEN the system SHALL parse the content and render it using the dashboard component renderer
2. WHEN the dashboard component is rendered THEN the system SHALL display the dashboard preview with appropriate controls (Preview, Save buttons)
3. IF the dashboard data is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and fall back to generic display

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want tool results containing error information to be displayed with proper error formatting, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool result contains JSON with type "error" THEN the system SHALL parse the content and render it using the error component renderer
2. WHEN the error component is rendered THEN the system SHALL display the error message, code, suggestions, and stack trace if available
3. WHEN error suggestions are provided THEN the system SHALL display them as actionable items

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want tool results containing upload prompts to be displayed as file upload interfaces, so that I can easily upload the requested files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool result contains JSON with type "upload_prompt" THEN the system SHALL parse the content and render it using the upload prompt component renderer
2. WHEN the upload prompt component is rendered THEN the system SHALL display the upload interface with accepted file types and target table information
3. WHEN the upload button is clicked THEN the system SHALL trigger the appropriate upload action

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the message parsing logic to be modular and extensible, so that new tool result types can be easily added in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new tool result types are added THEN the system SHALL support them without requiring changes to multiple files
2. WHEN the parsing logic is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing tool results
3. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error information for debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to gracefully handle malformed or unexpected tool result data, so that the chat interface remains functional even when errors occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tool result content is not valid JSON THEN the system SHALL display it as a generic tool result
2. WHEN tool result JSON lacks a type field THEN the system SHALL display it as a generic tool result
3. WHEN an unknown type is encountered THEN the system SHALL display it as a generic tool result with a warning
4. WHEN component rendering fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and fall back to generic display

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visual feedback in the input area when the system is processing my request, so that I know the system is actively working on my query.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat is in loading state THEN the input area border SHALL display a pulsing or moving animation
2. WHEN the loading state ends THEN the border animation SHALL stop and return to normal state
3. WHEN the input area is focused during loading THEN the animation SHALL not interfere with the focus styling
4. WHEN the animation is active THEN it SHALL be smooth and not cause performance issues

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see progress indicators for complex operations like widget and dashboard creation, so that I understand what the system is doing and how long it might take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool call message with name "render_widget" is received AND the system is loading AND it's the last message THEN the system SHALL display widget creation progress steps
2. WHEN a tool call message with name "render_dashboard" is received AND the system is loading AND it's the last message THEN the system SHALL display dashboard creation progress steps
3. WHEN displaying widget progress THEN the system SHALL show steps: "Analyzing user intent", "Gathering table data", "Generating SQL", "Creating widget"
4. WHEN displaying dashboard progress THEN the system SHALL show steps: "Analyzing user intent", "Creating dashboard plan", "Generating layout", "Generating widgets", "Finalizing changes"
5. WHEN the next message arrives THEN the progress animation SHALL disappear
6. WHEN the loading state ends THEN the progress animation SHALL disappear
7. WHEN progress steps are displayed THEN they SHALL loop through continuously until completion
